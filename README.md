# exampleWork 
This is a Git repository to hold example scripts from previous projects I have done. 

I am including two examples in this repository: my receiver-function processing scripts from the first year of my MSc and a recently translated script from a homework question from my Numerical Methods course at the University of Calgary. 

The receiver-function scripts showcase my ability to inherit code that was established and tailor the code to new applications. The numerical methods scripts show that I can easily translate from other languages (in this case MATLAB).
